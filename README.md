## Overview

Born from consolidating numerous containers onto my TrueNAS server, this project aims to organize the growing catalog using Docker Compose stacks.

## Highlights

- 🚀 Push to `nx start` (😅) simplicity for deploying dozens of containers on a single host
- 🧰 Dockge & Portainer included for additional point-and-click controls
- 🧱 Clearly separated stacks (`app`, `media`, `data`, etc.) for modular upgrades
- 📊 First-class observability via Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Dozzle, Beszel, & more!
- 🗂️ Monorepo structure keeps Compose services, env vars, and docs in one place with many improvements to come

## Best Practices

- 📂 Each stack ships with its own `compose.yaml` and `.env` file. Dockge auto-imports them on startup.
- 🔐 Keep sensitive values in the stack-specific `.env` files and never commit secrets to the repo.
- 🧩 Modify only the `.env` of the stack you intend to change to keep configurations isolated.
- ✨ Feel free to add, remove or modify stacks to your liking!
- ⚙️ Use `nx <command>` for everyday lifecycle tasks (start, stop, logs, backups, etc.).
- 📈 Monitor stack health via Beszel, Dockpeek, Dockge or Portainer.
- ♻️ By default, Watchtower will keep all deployed services up-to-date.
- 🧱 When adding new services, follow the existing folder pattern to keep stacks modular and easy to reason about.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jovalle/nexus
   cd nexus
   ./nx alias
   ```

2. Review `.env` files inside each stack and adjust values to match your environment (paths, credentials, network details).
3. Launch everything:

   ```sh
   nx start
   ```

   > 🧬 Migrating to/from TrueNAS? Change `DATA_PATH` and Nexus will feel instantly familiar.

4. Open Dockge (exposed via the root stack) to configure and monitor stacks.

> 🛠️ Prefer Portainer? It is included under the `core` stack. Open its web UI, import the Compose files, and manage stacks from there.

## Structure

```text

```

Stacks are intentionally scoped so you can update, pause, or extend categories independently.
